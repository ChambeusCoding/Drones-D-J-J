# DRONES D-D-J
This project was made in Python for a project in our computer programming class.

The goal is to fly a drone through multiple hoops and get the color of each hoop using **CODE ONLY**. This code, ran by running ```Main.py``` allows you to control the drone using user input on a keyboard.

Run main, and control the drone using the following inputs:

## INPUTS
**W, A, S, D** -> Forward, left, backward, right movement respectively (not up/down or turning).

**Arrow Keys** -> `UP` allows for flying up, while `DOWN` goes down. `RIGHT` and `LEFT` turn the drone right and left respectively.

**Q** -> Safe landing.

**L** -> Emergency landing. Gives 5 seconds to catch the drone before it falls from the sky. Try not to accidentally click.

**V** -> Special victory dance.

**E, F** -> Flip forward and backwards, respectively.

**R, T** -> Flip left and right, respectively.

### GOOD LUCK!
